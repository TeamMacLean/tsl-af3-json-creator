# AlphaFold3 .json Creator{.unnumbered}

Unlike AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3 allows users to analyse more complex protein interactions e.g. with ligands or nucleotides.  As such, we have created a python script to simplify the generation of .json files that are submitted to AlphaFold3 on the HPC.

## Installation{.unnumbered}

No installation required, simply source the package:

```bash
source package af3_tools-0.0.3
```


## Detailed Instructions for .json Creation{.unnumbered}

Given the different complex variations, we have put documentation on using the script for the different scenarios within this blog post.  Please use the links below for your specific use case.
